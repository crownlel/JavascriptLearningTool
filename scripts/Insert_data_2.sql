It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>JavaScript allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, including displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated graphics, and more. Initially developed for client-side programming, JavaScript now also runs on the server-side through platforms like Node.js, making it a full-stack development language.</p>
<p>With its non-blocking event-driven nature, JavaScript has become integral in creating highly responsive and efficient web applications. Whether you''re building a simple form or a complex web application, JavaScript provides the tools necessary to enhance user experience significantly.</p>
<p>In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of JavaScript, its role in web development, and why it is such a powerful tool for developers.</p>

INSERT [dbo].[CoursePages] ([CourseId], [Id], [Content]) VALUES (2, 1, N'<p>Variables in JavaScript are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated later in the code. You can declare a variable using <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>var</code> keyword was traditionally used to declare variables. However, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to provide better scoping and more predictable behavior.</p>
<p>Use <code>let</code> when you need a variable whose value might change. For example:</p>
<pre><code>let message = ''Hello, World!'';
message = ''Hello, JavaScript!'';</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>const</code> for variables that should not be reassigned. For example:</p>
<pre><code>const pi = 3.14159;</code></pre>
<p>Attempting to reassign a <code>const</code> variable will result in an error. Variable scope is also an important concept. Variables declared with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in. In contrast, variables declared with <code>var</code> are function-scoped.</p>

INSERT [dbo].[CoursePages] ([CourseId], [Id], [Content]) VALUES (1, 2, N'<p>JavaScript is essential for modern web development because it allows developers to create responsive and engaging user experiences. It enables features such as form validation, interactive maps, animations, and much more.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for JavaScript''s importance is its ability to execute directly in the user''s browser. This client-side execution means that JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML and CSS in real-time, creating an interactive user interface without needing to reload the page.</p>
<p>Additionally, JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, enabling developers to handle time-consuming tasks like fetching data from a server without blocking the main execution thread. This results in smoother and more performant web applications.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of JavaScript across all major browsers and its standardization by the ECMAScript specification ensure that code written in JavaScript will run consistently in different environments. As a result, developers can build cross-platform applications with relative ease.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we''ll delve deeper into JavaScript''s features and how they contribute to building modern, high-performing web applications.</p>

  <li><strong>Number:</strong> Used for numbers, both integers and floating-point. e.g., <code>42</code> or <code>3.14</code></li>
    <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> Represents true or false. e.g., <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Used for collections of data. Objects are key-value pairs. e.g., <code>{ name: ''John'', age: 30 }</code></li>
    <li><strong>Array:</strong> An ordered list of values. e.g., <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> or <code>[''apple'', ''banana'', ''cherry'']</code></li>
    <li><strong>Null:</strong> Represents the intentional absence of any object value. e.g., <code>null</code></li>
    <li><strong>Undefined:</strong> Represents an uninitialized variable. e.g., <code>let x;</code> (x is <code>undefined</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> A unique and immutable primitive value. e.g., <code>let sym = Symbol();</code></li>
    <li><strong>BigInt:</strong> Used for large integers beyond the safe integer limit of <code>Number</code>. e.g., <code>let bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in JavaScript. Each data type has specific characteristics and methods associated with it.</p>
  <p>For example, strings have methods for manipulating text, such as <code>toUpperCase()</code>, <code>substring()</code>, and <code>trim()</code>. Arrays have methods for manipulating lists of values, such as <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code>, <code>map()</code>, and <code>filter()</code>.</p>
  <p>Let''s see some examples:</p>
  <pre><code>// String example
  let greeting = ''Hello, World!'';
  console.log(greeting.toUpperCase()); // Output: HELLO, WORLD!
  
  // Array example
  let fruits = [''apple'', ''banana'', ''cherry''];

INSERT [dbo].[CoursePages] ([CourseId], [Id], [Content]) VALUES (1, 3, N'<p>JavaScript is executed in the browser, which means it can respond to user actions immediately without needing to communicate with the server. This capability makes web pages more interactive and efficient.</p>
<p>When a user interacts with a web page�such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or hovering over an element�JavaScript can capture these events and respond accordingly. This interaction is facilitated through the browser''s JavaScript engine, which interprets and executes the code.</p>
<p>For example, when a user clicks a button to reveal hidden content, JavaScript can dynamically manipulate the DOM to display the new content without requiring a page reload. This results in a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>
<p>Moreover, JavaScript can interact with various web APIs to enhance functionality. APIs such as the Geolocation API, Web Storage API, and Fetch API allow developers to access user location, store data locally, and make network requests, respectively.</p>
<p>Understanding how JavaScript operates in the browser is fundamental to leveraging its full potential. Throughout this course, we will explore practical examples of how JavaScript interacts with the browser to create dynamic and responsive web pages.</p>

INSERT [dbo].[CoursePages] ([CourseId], [Id], [Content]) VALUES (2, 3, N'<p>Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. You can define a function using the <code>function</code> keyword.</p>
<p>A basic function declaration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>function greet(name) {
  return ''Hello, '' + name + ''!'';
}</code></pre>
<p>Functions can take parameters and return values. The <code>return</code> statement specifies the value that will be returned by the function.</p>
<p>You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments inside the parentheses:</p>
<pre><code>console.log(greet(''Alice'')); // Output: Hello, Alice!</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript also supports anonymous functions, which do not have a name. These are often used as arguments to other functions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout(function() {
  console.log(''This message is delayed by 2 seconds'');
}, 2000);</code></pre>
<p>Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5</code></pre>
<p>Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and lexically bind the <code>this</code> value, making them particularly useful in certain contexts such as handling callbacks.</p>
